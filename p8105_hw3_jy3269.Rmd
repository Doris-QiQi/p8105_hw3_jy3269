## Problem 2

### 1. import csv file
```{r}
data_1 <- read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv")
data_1

```

### 2. clean and wrangle data

```{r}
acc_1 <- data_1 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    week = as.integer(week),
    day_id = as.integer(day_id),
    weekday_vs_weekend = if_else(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday","weekend","weekday") # new variable indicate whether the day is weekend or weekday
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(                          # switch the data set from wider to longer
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "minute",                 # activity_number in previous column names indicate the minute       
    names_prefix = "activity_",          # remove the activity_ prefix and preserve the number
    values_to = "activity_counts") %>%   # store the observed data in a new column names activity_counts
  mutate(minute = as.integer(minute))    # change the data class

acc_1
```

```{r}
acc_2 <- data_1 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    week = as.integer(week),
    day_id = as.integer(day_id),
    weekday_vs_weekend = if_else(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday","weekend","weekday") # new variable indicate whether the day is weekend or weekday
  ) %>% 
  select(week,day_id,day,weekday_vs_weekend,everything())

acc_2

```



### 3. total activity each day
```{r}
acc_2 %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = sum(activity_1:activity_1440)) %>%     # add a column to store the daily sum
  select(week,day_id,day,weekday_vs_weekend,total_activity,everything()) # show the new column at the front

```


```{r}
acc_1 %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  mutate(total_activity = sum(activity_counts))     # add a column to store the daily sum

```




### 4. make a table

```{r}
acc_2 %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_1:activity_1440)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()    # make an r table

```


```{r}
acc_1 %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_counts)) %>% 
  knitr::kable()    # make an r table

```




### 5. plot daily activity
```{r}
acc_1 %>%  
  group_by(day_id) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=minute,y=activity_counts,color=day))+
  geom_point()+geom
  
```

```{r}


```

```{r}
